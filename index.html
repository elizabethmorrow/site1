					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My decision to become an engineer stemmed from a love of problem-solving, and a passion for applying my skills to help others. In the summer of 2011, I worked as a lab assistant at the University of British Columbia, following my interest in the human machine relationship, specifically with regards to health care. It was here that I was first exposed to the role of mechatronics in everyday life, as prosthetic limbs and modifications to homes to accomodate disabilities. Since then, I have been actively developing and applying my skills as a multidiciplinary engineer, through my work in industry, in class, and extra-curricular activities and projects. I am an engineer, but I am also... </p>

								<h2>Work</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>I had 3 major projects while working at MedAvail, as well as daily testing and electrical CAD work. The Audio Test System is written in C# and used Fast Fourier Transforms to analyze audio signal quality and determine if a handset passed quality control. I also designed and wrote the Embedded Log Converter (also C#), a parsing app for the data packets received from the microcontrollers in the MedCentres to make them readable, and translatable. During my coop I also contributed to the Utility software suite, helping redesign the GUI and integrating a version of the log converter to translate machine logs in real time. </p>

								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>This past coop term was incredible, I learned so much taking multiple applications from an idea to a fully functional application ready to ship. Many thanks to the Controls Team at MedAvail, this term has only made me more excited to continue to develop my skills in software design! </p>
