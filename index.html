					<h2>Spring 2015</h2>
					<p>
					This summer I moved to Redmond, Washington to intern at Microsoft on the Visual Studio Platform team. I went through the Explorer program which allowed me to try out both Project Management and Software Engineering roles. I had a fantastic summer that culminated in winning the Intern Tech Fair! 
					</p>

					<h3>The Goal</h3>
					<p>Along with two other Explorer interns, my mission was to bring the Visual Studio experience to an entirely new audience: Lua developers. Lua is a lightweight scripting language used primarily for game development. Our initial scope did not include debugging due to time constraints, but I felt so strongly about its necessary inclusion in the project I ended up owning it end to end. </p>

					<h3>My Project </h3>
					<p> To write a Lua debugger capable of debugging scripts embedded in large host applications, and then integrate it into VS.</p>

					<h4>As a Project Manager...</h4>
					
					<p> I explored the competitive landscape of Lua tooling currently available. This included trying out other IDEs as well as doing customer research on social media, asking the development community what they would like to see. I wrote a functional spec detailing the user experience associated with my feature (the debugger), and held a review with members of the Visual Studio team to gather feedback, and finally began to implement my design.</p>

					<h4>As a Software Engineer...</h4>

					<p>Initially, we all spent time learning the Lua language. I did this by writing a WoW addon, and a simple game (think Snake, but with a cat...) using the LOVE framework. After that, I hand rolled a Lua lexer to be used as the base of our language model. Then, I got to get my hands dirty and start on the debugger. This project involved me learning very quickly about IPC mechanisms, threads, COM to integrate with VS, Microsoft Detours, native C++ mutexes and events, C# and DLL Injection. I learned what now seems like a crazy amount in 16 weeks, and enjoyed every minute of it. In the end, my demo of the VS Lua debug experience included breakpoints, stepping, and viewing the callstack.</p>

					<h3>The Result</h3>

					<p>As I mentioned before, our project won the Intern Tech Fair! It is now being taken on by a full time software engineer, which is amazing news. We're hoping to be able to open source a lot of it, so stay tuned for that. All in all, I'd like to thank my manager, my mentors, and my teammates. We accomplished something awesome, hopefully we can see the Lua community benefit as much from the end product as we did from the process.</p>

								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This past coop term was incredible, I learned so much taking multiple applications from an idea to a fully functional application ready to ship. Many thanks to the Controls Team at MedAvail, this term has only made me more excited to continue to develop my skills in software design! </p>

								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>I had 2 major independent projects while working at MedAvail, as well as daily testing and electrical CAD work.</p>
								<p> The Audio Test System is written in C# and uses Fast Fourier Transforms to analyze audio signal quality and determine if a handset passes quality control. The multithreaded interface stays responsive while the calculations and analysis run in the background. Settings only have to be configured once, and they are saved and set as the new default settings the next time the program is opened.</p>
								<p>I also designed and wrote the Embedded Log Converter in C#, a parsing application for the data packets received from the microcontrollers in the MedCentres to make them readable, and translatable. Using a hash table, the average look-up was O(1) and the converter is able to run as an extension of the Utility tools, translating in real time! </p>
								<p> During my coop I also contributed to the Utility software suite, helping redesign the GUI using a wireframing tool called Balsamiq.</p>

							<h3>Kik Hackathon</h3>
								<p>The weekend of January 30 - February 1 2015 I was very excited to participate in the Kik Hackathon! I'd been meaning to do some Android application development and this weekend presented the perfect opportunity. The idea was to create a voice-controlled alarm application, to set or snooze alarms using Wit.Ai and Android Studio. Currently the only ringtone option is Space Jam.
								</p>
								<p>The experience was a lot of fun, I learned a lot about developing for a mobile platform, and plan to continue doing this in my spare time.</p>
