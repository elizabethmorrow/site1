								<p>This past coop term was incredible, I learned so much taking multiple applications from an idea to a fully functional application ready to ship. Many thanks to the Controls Team at MedAvail, this term has only made me more excited to continue to develop my skills in software design! </p>

								<h3>My Experience</h3>
								<p>I had 2 major independent projects while working at MedAvail, as well as daily testing and electrical CAD work.</p>
								<p> The Audio Test System is written in C# and uses Fast Fourier Transforms to analyze audio signal quality and determine if a handset passes quality control. The multithreaded interface stays responsive while the calculations and analysis run in the background. Settings only have to be configured once, and they are saved and set as the new default settings the next time the program is opened.</p>
								<p>I also designed and wrote the Embedded Log Converter in C#, a parsing application for the data packets received from the microcontrollers in the MedCentres to make them readable, and translatable. Using a hash table, the average look-up was O(1) and the converter is able to run as an extension of the Utility tools, translating in real time! </p>
								<p> During my coop I also contributed to the Utility software suite, helping redesign the GUI using a wireframing tool called Balsamiq.</p>

							<h3>Solar Car Control System</h3>
								<p> This winter I'm very excited to take a lead role in developing the firmware for the 11th Midnight Sun Solar car, as one of the Electrical Team leads. Currently I am working on the CAN communication on the main board, and will soon be putting together an electrical harness to simulate and test the start-up procedures of the solar car. Ask me about how it's going!</p>

								<p>At Midnight Sun we develop primarily in C, using CodeComposer for an IDE. Right now the main priority of the Electrical team is getting the new code and the new board revisions up and running, as we aim to compete in the World Solar Challenge in Australia 2015. </p>

							<h3>Kik Hackathon</h3>
								<p>The weekend of January 30 - February 1 2015 I was very excited to participate in the Kik Hackathon! I'd been meaning to do some Android application development and this weekend presented the perfect opportunity. The idea was to create a voice-controlled alarm application, to set or snooze alarms using Wit.Ai and Android Studio. Currently the only ringtone option is Space Jam.
								</p>
								<p>The experience was a lot of fun, I learned a lot about developing for a mobile platform, and plan to continue doing this in my spare time.</p>
